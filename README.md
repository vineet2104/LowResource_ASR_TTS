# Speech Synthesis for Low Resource Languages using Transliteration Enabled Transfer Learning

## Abstract 

In the area of Human Computer Interaction, Text To Speech (TTS) synthesis has received a significant boost in recent years. One of the major reasons for this is the development of various deep learning techniques capable of generating excellent quality speech.  However, deep learning demands a vast quantity of data, with speech recognition and synthesis systems requiring more than thousand hours of aligned corpus to train end-to-end systems. While a large amount of open source data is available for high resource languages such as English, Spanish, and Italian, the majority of Asian and African languages have little to no training data. This paper gives a novel method for doing TTS through transliteration activated transfer learning, an intuitive yet powerful method to boost the learning process in speech synthesis. Transliteration is essential in transferring phonetic information from one language to another. By incorporating this method in a novel speech synthesis pipeline, we demonstrate accelerated training and improved speech quality. Our approach received an average Mean Opinion Score of 4.65 out of 5 based on a survey of 100+ persons. We also make our code repository available to boost future research.
