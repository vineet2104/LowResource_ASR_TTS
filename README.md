# Automatic Speech Recognition and Text to Speech for Low Resource Languages

## Abstract 

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text to Speech (TTS) research have been boosted in recent years with the development of deep learning systems. These systems
rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data which is possible only in widely spoken languages such as English, Spanish, and German. For developing such systems in
low resource languages, we must rely on shared knowledge across languages and the ability of deep learning systems to finetune for specific tasks. In this project, we explore the problem
statements of Automatic Speech Recognition and Text to Speech in detail, emphasizing working in Low Resource Languages.
